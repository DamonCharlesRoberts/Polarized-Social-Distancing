# Polarized-Social-Distancing

* In this project, I use SafeGraph Proprietary foot traffic data to analyze whether there are differences among partisan counties. 
* In the CommentedDataCleaning.R file, you will find code where I cleaned the SafeGraph data downloaded from AWS - to get access to this proprietary dataset, you must reach out to SafeGraph. 
* StataCanDoIt.do is also a significant file in the project - this is where all the code for analyses were ran. 

* This code switched to Stata due to memory issues on my local machine for running Fixed Effects and Random Effects models in R.
